## Zsh-Util
Herein Lie My Latest Zsh Config files.

I started using **Zsh** recently on my Mac with the *Oh my Zsh* framework on top of it, because i thought it would bring life to my dead terminal and would be able to have a Great Terminal Experience. I use my Custom theme with some basic level Tweaks. It's running atop *iTerm 2* as i didn't wanna hamper my bash experience which is in the Default Terminal.app .

I recently moved to win10 with ubuntu WSL

This Contains:
* .aliases
* .bash_profile
* .zshrc
* aditya.zsh-theme
* batcharge.py (getting battery status on Mac)
* batterywsl.plugin.zsh (getting os battery status in WSL)
