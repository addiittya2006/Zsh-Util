# Zsh-Util
Herein Lie My Latest Zsh Config files.

I started using **Zsh** recently on my Mac with the *Oh my Zsh* framework on top of it, because i thought it would bring life to my dead terminal and would be able to have a Great Terminal Experience. I use my Custom theme with some basic level Tweaks. It's running atop *iTerm 2* as i didn't wanna hamper my bash experience which is in the Default Terminal.app .

This Contains:
* aditya.zsh-theme
* zshrc (rc file)
* batchrge (getting battery status on Mac)

This is what it Looks like now -<br>
